# uiuc-free-food-bot

A bot that was originally meant to read the tweets from UIUC_Free_Food account and post them into discord servers and update when necessary.

However due to recent twitter API server side issues and restrictions on reading tweets, this bot is no longer useful nor being worked on.

Project libraries needed:
```
tweepy
discord.py
dotenv
```

Worked on during UIUC SOSP 2023.
